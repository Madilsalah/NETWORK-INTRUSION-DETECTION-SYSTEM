There you can see all the code and description  of network intrusion detection system...
Creating a practical network intrusion detection system (NIDS) using Snort or Suricata involves setting up the IDS, configuring detection rules, and implementing alerting and visualization mechanisms. Here’s a step-by-step practical guide to setting up and using Snort or Suricata as an IDS:
Step 1: Install Snort or Suricata
- Environment: Use a Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 or later), which is ideal for running network analysis tools.
- Installing Dependencies:
  - Update your system: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  - Install dependencies: sudo apt install -y build-essential libpcap-dev libpcre3-dev libdumbnet-dev
- Installing Snort (alternative commands for Suricata follow in brackets if different):
  - Download Snort: sudo apt install snort (For Suricata: sudo apt install suricata).
  - Verify installation: snort -V (or suricata -V).
Step 2: Configure Network Interface
To monitor all traffic, set the interface to promiscuous mode:
sudo ifconfig [interface] promisc
Replace [interface] with your network interface (e.g., eth0 or wlan0). 
Step 3: Write and Test Detection Rules
Intrusion Detection Systems operate using detection rules. Below are some examples of Snort rules to get started:
Example Rules:
1. Detect a Ping (ICMP) Scan:
   alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
2. Detect SSH Login Attempt from a Specific IP:
   alert tcp 192.168.1.1 any -> any 22 (msg:"SSH login attempt"; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
3. Detect HTTP Traffic on a Non-Standard Port:
   alert tcp any any -> any !80 (msg:"HTTP on Non-Standard Port"; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
Configuring Rules in Snort/Suricata:
- Snort: Place your rules in /etc/snort/rules/local.rules.
- Suricata: Place rules in /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules.
After adding rules, update the configuration to ensure they load. For Snort, you can include include $RULE_PATH/local.rules in the /etc/snort/snort.conf file.
Step 4: Start the IDS
Run Snort or Suricata in monitoring mode to capture and analyze network traffic.
Snort Command:
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i [interface]
Suricata Command:
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i [interface]
Replace [interface] with your network interface.
Step 5: Configure Alerts and Logging
Both Snort and Suricata support alerting mechanisms. By default, they log alerts to files in /var/log/snort/ or /var/log/suricata/. Here’s how to configure logging:
- Snort:
  - In snort.conf, set the output alert_fast or output alert_full options.
  - To customize log locations, specify paths with output log_tcpdump.
- Suricata:
  - In suricata.yaml, configure default-log-dir to change the log path.
  - Set alert-log to control alert outputs.
Step 6: Automate Responses
Create scripts to respond automatically to certain alerts:
Example Script to Block IP with iptables:
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -s [IP_ADDRESS] -j DROP
Replace [IP_ADDRESS] with the IP you want to block based on alerts.
Step 7: Visualize Detected Attacks
To make sense of the log data, use visualization tools like Kibana with Elasticsearch for powerful analytics and visualizations.
1. Install Elasticsearch and Kibana:
   sudo apt install elasticsearch kibana
2. Configure Logstash to parse Snort/Suricata logs:
   Create a configuration file /etc/logstash/conf.d/snort.conf.
3. Run Logstash to start sending Snort logs to Elasticsearch:
   sudo systemctl start logstash
4. Create Kibana Dashboard:
   Open Kibana (typically at http://localhost:5601), connect to the snort-alerts-* index, and create visualizations or dashboards for analyzing intrusion patterns.
Step 8: Testing and Fine-Tuning
Generate Test Traffic: Use tools like Nmap and Metasploit to simulate attacks.
Review Alerts: Check if Snort or Suricata correctly logs alerts for simulated attacks.
Adjust Rules: Refine rule sensitivity and remove false positives.
This setup should give you a working NIDS capable of detecting and logging intrusions with visual analysis. Let me know if you need assistance with any specific part of the implementation!
